// Amazon uses different sizes of boxes for customer shipment. In order to save some space, the boxes are usually flattened and embeded together. i.e. a small box as 6x10 after flatterned can be inserted into a large box as 7x11 after flatterned. Now, given a set of flatterend boxes, can you help to come up with an algorithm to find the largest embeded boxes? 

int largestNum(List<int[]> boxes) {
    Comparator<int[]> comparator = new Comparator<>(){
        public int compare(int[] a, int[] b){
            if(a[0] == b[0]){
                return a[1] - b[1];
            }
            return a[0] - b[0];
    }};    
    Collections.sort(boxes, comparator);  // nlogn
    
    int[] dp = new int[boxes.size()];
    int max = 0;
    dp[0] = 1;
    for(int i = 1; i < boxes.size(); i++){
        int x = 0;
        for(int j = 0; j < i; j++){
            if(x < dp[j] && boxes.get(j)[1] < boxes.get(i)[1] && boxes.get(j)[0] < boxes.get(i)[0]){
                x = dp[j];
            }
        }
        dp[i] = x + 1;  
        max = Math.max(max, dp[i]);
    }
    return max;
}
// 6x10, 7x14, 7x17, 8x12, 9x6, 10x20
// DP
dp[i] = max(dp[j]) + 1 (j < i)





// After buying WholeFoods, now Amazon has more and more retail locations which can be set up as a tiny sorting center. With multiple such tiny Fulfillment Centers in the city, 1-day delivery or even 2-hour delivery for grocery products becomes possible. As products shipped to customers from these tiny FCs, it is also important to keep the suppliment. In order to do that, Amazon set up solid bus routes driving between two Large FCs and passing those tiny FCs. i.e. (A -> a -> b-> c-> ... -> B) where A, B are two Amazon owned Large Fulfillment centers located far away from downtown area, and a, b, c are the small area inside retail grocery stores in the city. This is a single route (assuming it would come back the next day from B -> A) and during the trip the bus needs to move packages from start location to destination. 
// Now, at the beginning of one day, all package movements have been planned, given a bus with fixed capacity, assuming all packages are the same size, can you help to figure out if the given bus would be able to finish all package movement requests in one trip?

// Amazon, as a retail platform, would always like to analyze which product is the best seller. This would help Amazon to focus on products refills to ensure enough suppliment of products for customer. To define popular of products, there are multiple different ways. Could be based on quantity, number of different customer orders, different time periods, etc. Now, let's simply say the most resent ordered product is the most popular one. Can you help to use your OOD konwledge to design a solution to fetch the most popular product in real time?
